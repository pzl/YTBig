# YTBig

adds keyboard shortcuts to youtube pages to view the videos a little larger

## What?

I use the [HTML5 beta](http://www.youtube.com/html5) and [Feather beta](http://www.youtube.com/feather_beta) so my youtube player misses the "larger player" button most of the time. But I want a larger player. So I wrote a chrome extension to do that for me on keystroke.

## OK, how?
load the extension, (no it's not in the chrome store, just do it locally) and on a youtube video page press ctrl+y to see your video player enlarge to about 1200x700 px. And if you press ctrl+m, the page will try to scroll to the upper-left corner of the video if your window is small enough to scroll. 

The plugin also removes scrollbars, just bcuz.

## options page?
It exists, but it does nothing. I started to create a page where you could choose arbitrary player sizes and keystroke commands, but after a few months of use, I never needed another player size, and I expect no one else will use this. Open an issue if you want to see it (or something cooler like draggable resize video as if it were a window).

## support
youtube changes their layout and HTML code *a lot*. It's very likely this extension will break frequently as youtube updates their site. There is no guarantee I will ever keep up with their changes.
